## Important foreword
This tool relies on accurate timings to retrieve and manipulate data. The application will seemingly "sleep" but it will do its thing's. To ensure compatibility of all users across all different connection speeds this is neccesary. 

If there is any error or cancel of action IT WILL DO tell you!!

If you are intending to use this Tool on a new account you have to atleast kill one pokemon and progress to stage 2. This ensures you will have some savedata that also can be manipulated.

When you launch the tool and login it will create a trainer.json - this is your save-data and is very precious. Please make a copy of it just in case anything goes wrong. We take no responsibility for your actions when using this script. 
```

We will not use the tool 24/7 - this means we will not see when it breaks due to changes on PokeRoGue's site. Please report on our discord or GitHub whenever you cannot finish any action.

## How to use the tool

- Step 1: Download the release according to your operating system
- Step 2: Extract the archived data you downloaded
- Step 3: Navigate into the compiled/ folder and launch `onlineEditor-[yourOperatingSystem]`
- Step 4: Enter your login data. Your password is in a hidden field. You are entering despite it doesnt look like it. Just login!
- Step 5: A chrome testsuite will open and process your login and retrieve the needed data. Do not touch anything even after logging in. The Browser will close at some point and process your login in the console.

  - It will look like its doing nothing but this is to ensure accurate results accross any network connection speed. If it will fail it will tell you so!
- Step 6: Now we are logged in and you can type the number of Action you want and follow the instructions.

  - Please do not open a new session of PokeRoGue once you are logged in by the console. This will revert the session and you will need to restart the tool and log in again.
- Step 7: Type the command "1" which is Update all data on the server when you are happy with your edit to load up the data.

- Step 8: Refresh the Page. When everything worked your changes should be applied.
